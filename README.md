For our fourth project for CPSC 581 (Human Computer Interaction II), we were asked to:  
Create a physical prototype to solve an everyday problem. Solve an everyday problem with arduino with the following rules:  
  1. You must have at least one output and input device (see sensor sheet).  
  2. All wires/boards must be hidden (anything that does not need to be exposed is covered) by using physical prototyping.  


**Overall Description**  
Our project is called, “Let There Be Light”. Our project allows its users, primarily students; to always be notified when their bag is unintentionally left open. This allows students to keep the contents of their bag safe and exercise the security of their personal belongings.

Our project helps with this problem, by alerting the user with some sort of sound like a buzzer that will grab the user’s attention. The idea is that when the bag is open, the buzzer will continuously go off. Then when the bag is closed, the buzzer will turn off.

The system can be used to turn on/off using the remote, this provides proper usability for the users. This allows the student to stop the buzzing sound and be able to open their bag without the inconvenient buzzer sound. For the system to be used again, the student must turn on the system with the switch.
