For our fourth project for CPSC 581 (Human Computer Interaction II), we were asked to:  
Create a physical prototype to solve an everyday problem. Solve an everyday problem with arduino with the following rules:  
  1. You must have at least one output and input device (see sensor sheet).  
  2. All wires/boards must be hidden (anything that does not need to be exposed is covered) by using physical prototyping.
